# My Portfolio

The landing page includes a couple paragraphs to introduce myself and give some background information. The portfolio page includes some pictures of my projects I have been working on since I have joined the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp in September 2020. You can click on images to see the deployed projects. The contact page currently does not have a funcitonality, but it will be up and working in the future.
