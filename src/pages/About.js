            <p>Hello there! My name is Umut Alptekin. I am currently looking for a job as either an engineer, or a Full-Stack/Back-end developer.
          </p>

            <p>I have recently graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in May 2020,
            and, shortly after, finished a 3-month long bootcamp about Full-Stack Web Development from University of Texas at Austin.
          </p>

            <p>For some background information, I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. I have gone to Lyc√©e Saint-Joseph Istanbul, a French high school, then moved to USA to attend Penn State University.
            Currently, I am back in Istanbul for the foreseeable future, but still open to relocating to another country to chase a work opportunity.
          </p>

            <p>The bootcamp was a very interesting and constructive experience for me. I have learned so much about coding in general, project workflow in software, and about web development itself.
            Every week, I was challenged with a new project about a new topic, and had to learn how to use the tools I was just introduced to pretty much on the job.
            After the bootcamp, I am still learning more about the tools and technologies to better leverage them, and finding different solutions to given problems.
          </p>

            <p>While in Penn State, I loved studying engineering, since the technical problem-solving aspect gives me quite a lot of joy.
            One of the most memorable things I was involved in was my capstone project where my teammates and I were building a gas-powered, fiberglass car with the maximum fuel efficiency as possible.
            Our plans to use it in the Shell Eco-marathon competition could not happen, it was still an amazing experience.
          </p>
