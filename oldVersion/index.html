                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Umut and I am currently on my way to become a Full-Stack Web Developer
                    thanks
                    to the coding bootcamp at UT Austin. I have recently earned a Bachelor's degree in mechanical
                    engineering, however, during this shaky time in the job market,
                    I've decided to dive into an industry which I had an interest in but no time for previously.</p>

                <p>For some background information, I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. I have gone to a French
                    high
                    school in Istanbul, then moved to USA to attend Penn State University.
                    I had the chance to study an interesting subject and took part on many technical projects like
                    building
                    a gas-powered car as my capstone project, as well as lived in a foreing culture for several years,
                    all
                    of which I enjoyed every moment.
                    After finishing college and having a job-hunting period in the USA, I have come back to Istanbul.
                </p>

                <p>Currently, I am not certain about whether I will look for a job in web development or in engineering
                    after I am done with my coding bootcamp, but having multiple options is something very valuable for
                    me.
                    I'll see where future takes me...</p>
